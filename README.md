# Open data and source-code in science (specifically, economics)

## Licensing

Difference license styles should be used for data and source-code.

The [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), [BSD license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses), and [OpenBSD license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) are permissive, attribution-only licenses suitable for source-code.

[CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) is an attribution-only license suitable for data and creative works.


## Data and source-code repository platforms

As long as research articles persist, so should the respective data and source-code. Accordingly, one may wish to consider the lifetime of repositories.

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is operated by CERN, backed by the EU.

[Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) is a platform operated by the [Center for Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Open_Science), a non-profit.

[openICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/) depends on infrastructure hosted by the University of Michigan.  [The service had an outage on 2023-08-27](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/posts/2023-08-29-notice-downtime) which may call into question their reliability and perhaps even longevity.

[The AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea) is a branded repository hosted by ICPSR on the same platform.

## Pre-print platforms

arXiv is the preferred repository for the fields it services (including economics). It is operated by Cornell University.

SocArXiv serves social sciences, humanities, education, and law. It is operated by the Center for Open Science and is integrated with OSF.

SSRN should be avoided, as it is privately owned.
